I enjoy both steak and salad. Sometimes chicken too!
A healthy diet includes fish, meat, and vegetables. 
Grilled chicken with rice is a great meal. Better than Bacon. 
I eat both animal products and plant-based foods.
Bacon and eggs are my favorite breakfast.
I love burgers and fries with a soda.
A good diet balances meat like chicken, dairy like milk, and vegetables like broccoli.
Seafood like shrimp and salmon is delicious.
Barbecue ribs and corn on the cob are great together.
Eating both meat and plants provides a variety of nutrients.
